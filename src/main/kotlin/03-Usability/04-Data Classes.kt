/*
Imagine you have a small backpack that you use only for carrying your pencils, erasers, and a ruler.
This backpack is special because it has just the right pockets and zippers made especially for these items.
You don't use this backpack for anything elseâ€”just for these specific things.

In the same way, a "data class" in Kotlin is a special type of class made just for holding data.
It doesn't have fancy actions or behaviors; it just carries data neatly, like how your small backpack neatly holds your pencils,
erasers, and ruler
 */

// the primary goal of a data class is to hold data
// Rules for data classes:
        // the primary constructor needs to have at least one parameter
        // the params need to be declared with val || vars
        // data classes cannot be open, inner, abstract or sealed
fun main() {
    val person = Person(name = "Noli", age = 27)
    val person2 = Person(name = "Noli", age = 27)
    println(person == person2)
    val person3 = person.copy( age = 30)
    println(person3.toString())

}

data class Person (
    val name: String,
    val age: Int
